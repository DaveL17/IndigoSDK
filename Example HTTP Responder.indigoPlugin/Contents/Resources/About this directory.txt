The Resources directory may be included in a plugin. There are a few items in this directory that have special
meaning if included. Otherwise, the files in this directory can be used for anything you like.

The following directories, if included in the directory, will be automatically made available directly from HTTP from
the Indigo Web Server (IWS):

Resources/images/
Resources/static/
Resources/video/

Any items in these directories will be available directly from IWS by specifying the URL like this but by substituting
the plugin ID of your plugin:

https://myreflector.indigodomo.net/com.indigodomo.indigoplugin.example-http-responder/images/test.png
https://myreflector.indigodomo.net/com.indigodomo.indigoplugin.example-http-responder/static/html/test.html
https://myreflector.indigodomo.net/com.indigodomo.indigoplugin.example-http-responder/static/css/test.css

Note, anything served from these directories will need an authenticated connection by using HTTP authentication
or by passing an api_key as part of the query string.

We will also make available the following directory:

Resources/public/

at the URL:

https://myreflector.indigodomo.net/com.indigodomo.indigoplugin.example-http-responder/public/public.txt

if you need to serve content to anyone that asks for it without any authentication.

Any other content in the Resources directory will not automatically be served by IWS. Of course, you can also use
your Mac's bonjour name/IP address if on the local network or localhost if you're on the same Mac (just specify the
correct port, 8176 by default).

NOTE: if you add any of the above directories after you've deployed your plugin for testing, you will also need to
bounce IWS:
