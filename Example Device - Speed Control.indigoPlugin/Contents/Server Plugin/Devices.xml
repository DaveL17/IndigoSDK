<!-- If your plugin defines device types, you can define them here.

	 Devices must specify their type (via the type attribute):

		relay (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		dimmer (ON/OFF/DIM/BRIGHTEN/SET BRIGHTNESS/STATUS)
		speedcontrol (ON/OFF/SET SPEED LEVEL/SET SPEED INDEX/INCREASE/DECREASE/STATUS)
		sensor (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		thermostat
		sprinkler
		custom

	 The first six inherit states, actions and events from Indigo. You can
	 also specify your own custom actions and additional states, if needed.

	 The Device example below specifies the speedcontrol type.
	 
	 Devices must also specify a unique typeID - so, for instance, if you define
	 2 speedcontrol type devices then your plugin can distinguish between the two by
	 the typeID.
-->

<Devices>
	<!-- This device illustrates how a plugin can inherit Indigo's speedcontrol
	device behavior including on/off states, and speed changes, and will support
	Indigo and Indigo Touch's native UI for speedcontrol type devices.
	-->
	<Device type="speedcontrol" id="mySpeedControlType">
		<Name>Example Ceiling Fan Module</Name>
		<ConfigUI>
			<!-- The ConfigUI here is just an example of the type of device
			specific UI that might be needed. Here you might specify a text
			field for an IP address, a serial port popup, or other device
			specific options.
			-->
			<Field id="address" type="textfield" defaultValue="123456">
				<Label>Module Address:</Label>
			</Field>
		</ConfigUI>
		<States>
			<!-- By default speedcontrol type devices automatically inherit the
			states: onOffState, speedIndex, speedLevel.

			The plugin can specify additional custom states and custom
			actions (in Actions.xml) to modify custom states. As an example
			here, we define a new custom state, backlightBrightness, which
			is used to control the brightness of the backlit display of
			the module.
			-->
			<State id="backlightBrightness">
				<ValueType>Integer</ValueType>
				<TriggerLabel>Backlight Brightness</TriggerLabel>
				<ControlPageLabel>Backlight Brightness</ControlPageLabel>
			</State>
		</States>
	</Device>
